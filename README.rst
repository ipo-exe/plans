``plans`` - Planning Nature-based Solutions
###########################################

The ``plans`` tool is a software designed to help watershed restoration projects. It is uses simulation models for mapping *hydrological processes* such as `surface runoff`_ and infiltration_ for a given area of interest. Those simulation maps then can be used by water resource managers for effectively planning the expansion of `Nature-based Solutions for Water`_ (*e.g.*, reforestation and soil-conservation agriculture).

Example of model outputs:
